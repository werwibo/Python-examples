The Pythoncode asks for 3 Integers as R G B Input.
Input is checked. If wrong or not complete: Message Box with error-message.
If Input is ok, then a second window is opened, showing the color, resulting from RGB-Input.
The title of the second window shows the Input-Integers and the pygame-colorname nearest to RGB.
(A little Dictioary is used with RGB as key and colorname as value.)

For the founded nearest colorname the corresponding color is presented as background of a Frame in the Input-Window.
The Input Window is made with tkinter and grid, but the Frame is added without grid-using.
As header-icon of the input-window rgb-ww.ico is set.
